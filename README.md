#### Google Colab
The product I'm exploring is technically not a product, but it's used frequently.
At first glance, the interface is similar to Jupyter Notebook, but it's more amazing!
You can make sections, add formated text with LaTeX (LaTeX Wizards, Show yourself!!), view files connected to the code, etc.
It can do cloud computing, therefore you don't have to worry about your potato laptop :").
You can share your code easily to other people and code together with your team!
It requires no setup and accesible from all kind of browsers.
Also it's integrated with google drive, the platform we're familiar with :).
Recently, Google colab added support for Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which means a lot for aspiring AI/ML user like me.
And the most amazing thing about this product is?????? IT'S FREEE!!! Everyone can use it :) (You still need a laptop and internet connection though).
But you still need to be careful if you're uploading sensitive data or information to google colab :).
